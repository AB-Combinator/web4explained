    question: "Is Web 4.0 real?",
    answer:
      "Yes and no. Web 4.0 is not a single product or protocol you can download — it's a label for a convergence of technologies that are already emerging. AI agents are executing autonomous transactions today. Digital twins are managing factories and cities. The EU has a formal Web 4.0 strategy. The underlying technologies are real and deployed. What's uncertain is the timeline, the final form, and whether 'Web 4.0' will be the name that sticks.",
  },
  {
    question: "When is Web 4.0 coming?",
    answer:
      "The infrastructure is being laid right now (2025-2026). Gartner predicts 40% of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by end of 2026. The agentic AI market is projected to reach $52 billion by 2030. Most analysts place the Web 4.0 transition window at 2026-2030. But web eras don't have clean start dates — they overlap and blend. Pieces of Web 4.0 are live today; the full vision is years away.",
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between Web 4.0 and Web3?",
    answer:
      "Web3 is primarily about decentralization and ownership — blockchain, tokens, NFTs, DAOs. It's about who controls the data. Web 4.0 is about intelligence and agency — AI agents, autonomous systems, human-machine symbiosis. It's about what the web can do on its own. Web 4.0 may use blockchain infrastructure (for agent payments and identity), but the core thesis is AI-driven autonomy, not decentralization.",
  },
  {
    question: "Who coined the term Web 4.0?",
    answer:
      "There's no single inventor. The concept has been discussed in academic literature since the early 2010s. The European Commission gave it institutional weight in July 2023 with their formal 'Web 4.0 and Virtual Worlds' strategy. In the crypto/AI community, the term gained traction in 2024-2025 as AI agents began autonomously transacting on blockchain networks. It emerged organically from multiple communities simultaneously.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Web 4.0 just AI hype?",
    answer:
      "Skepticism is warranted — Web3 promised decentralization and the internet got more centralized. Some of what's called 'Web 4.0' is repackaged AI marketing. But the underlying shift is real: AI agents are becoming capable of autonomous action, and the infrastructure to support them (MCP, crypto rails, edge computing) is being built. The question isn't whether AI agents will act autonomously — they already do. The question is how far it goes and who controls it.",
  },
  {
    question: "What companies are building Web 4.0?",
    answer:
      "No single company owns Web 4.0. The ecosystem includes AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind), spatial computing companies (Apple, Meta), cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP), blockchain networks (Ethereum, Solana, Base), IoT platforms, and thousands of startups building agentic tools. The EU is the most significant government actor, with formal strategy and funded initiatives like CitiVerse and Destination Earth.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need crypto for Web 4.0?",
    answer:
      "Not necessarily. The 'agentic web' vision of Web 4.0 uses crypto rails for autonomous agent payments — because AI agents need programmable money that doesn't require human approval per transaction. But the 'symbiotic web' and EU policy visions of Web 4.0 don't require crypto at all. They focus on AI, IoT, spatial computing, and digital twins. Crypto is one infrastructure layer, not a prerequisite.",
